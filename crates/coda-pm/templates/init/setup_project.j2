You are initializing a repository for use with CODA (Claude Orchestrated Development Agent).

## Repository

- **Root**: `{{ project_root }}`

## Analysis Results

{{ analysis_result }}

## Task

Perform the following steps in order:

### 1. Create `.coda/` directory

```bash
mkdir -p "{{ project_root }}/.coda"
```

### 2. Create `.trees/` directory

```bash
mkdir -p "{{ project_root }}/.trees"
```

### 3. Generate `.coda/config.yml`

Create the file `{{ project_root }}/.coda/config.yml`. Based on the detected tech stack in the analysis results above, determine the appropriate build/lint/format checks for this project and fill them in.

```yaml
# CODA Project Configuration
version: 1

agent:
  model: "claude-opus-4-6"
  permission_mode: "auto"
  max_retries: 3

prompts:
  extra_dirs: []

git:
  auto_commit: true
  branch_prefix: "feature"
  commit_prefix: "feat"

review:
  enabled: true
  checks:
    # Determine appropriate checks from the detected tech stack.
    # Examples:
    #   Rust: cargo build, cargo +nightly fmt -- --check, cargo clippy -- -D warnings
    #   Node: npm run build, npm run lint, npm test
    #   Python: ruff check, mypy, pytest
    - "<fill based on tech stack>"
  max_review_rounds: 5
```

### 4. Update `.gitignore`

Append the following to `{{ project_root }}/.gitignore` (create the file if it doesn't exist). Only add lines that are not already present:

```
# CODA worktrees
.trees/
```

### 5. Generate `.coda.md`

Generate a concise repository overview document at `{{ project_root }}/.coda.md`. This file serves as a quick-reference guide for AI agents. Include:

1. **Project Overview** — One paragraph describing what this project does
2. **Architecture** — Brief description with ASCII diagram if applicable
3. **Directory Guide** — Table of important directories and their purposes
4. **Tech Stack** — Languages, frameworks, key dependencies
5. **Development Workflow** — How to build, test, and run the project
6. **Key Patterns** — Important conventions used in this codebase

Base the content on the analysis results above. Keep under 200 lines.

### 6. Update `CLAUDE.md`

If `{{ project_root }}/CLAUDE.md` exists, append the following reference at the end (skip if already present):

```markdown

## CODA Repository Documentation

See [.coda.md](.coda.md) for a comprehensive overview of this repository's structure, tech stack, and conventions. This file is auto-generated by CODA and kept up to date.
```

If `CLAUDE.md` does not exist, create it with just the above content.

## Verification

After completing all steps, verify:
- [ ] `.coda/` directory exists
- [ ] `.trees/` directory exists
- [ ] `.coda/config.yml` is valid YAML with appropriate checks
- [ ] `.gitignore` contains `.trees/`
- [ ] `.coda.md` exists and is well-formatted
- [ ] `CLAUDE.md` references `.coda.md`

Report the result of each verification step.
