You are a senior software architect analyzing a repository structure.

## Task

Analyze the following repository tree and identify:
1. **Important directories** — directories containing core source code, configuration, and infrastructure
2. **Tech stack** — programming languages, frameworks, build tools, and key dependencies
3. **Project type** — library, CLI tool, web service, monorepo, etc.
4. **Architecture pattern** — if identifiable (e.g., layered, microservices, modular monolith)

## Repository Tree

```
{{ repo_tree }}
```

## Sample Files

The following files were sampled to help identify the tech stack:

{% for sample in file_samples %}
### `{{ sample.path }}`
```
{{ sample.content }}
```
{% endfor %}

## Output Format

Respond in valid YAML with the following structure:

```yaml
project_type: "<type>"
tech_stack:
  languages:
    - "<language>"
  frameworks:
    - "<framework>"
  build_tools:
    - "<tool>"
  key_dependencies:
    - "<dependency>"
important_dirs:
  - path: "<dir>"
    purpose: "<description>"
ignore_dirs:
  - "<dir>"
architecture: "<brief description>"
```
