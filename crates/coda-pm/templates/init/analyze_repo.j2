You are a senior software architect performing a deep analysis of a repository structure.

## Task

Analyze the following repository tree and identify:
1. **Important directories** — directories containing core source code, configuration, and infrastructure
2. **Tech stack** — programming languages, frameworks, build tools, and key dependencies
3. **Project type** — library, CLI tool, web service, monorepo, etc.
4. **Architecture pattern** — if identifiable (e.g., layered, microservices, modular monolith)
5. **Key interfaces** — core traits, interfaces, or abstract types that define module boundaries and contracts
6. **Data flows** — primary data processing pipelines, request handling paths, or state transitions
7. **Error handling pattern** — how errors are defined, propagated, and handled across the codebase
8. **Concurrency model** — async runtime, threading strategy, synchronization primitives used

## Repository Tree

```
{{ repo_tree }}
```

## Sample Files

The following files were sampled to help identify the tech stack:

{% for sample in file_samples %}
### `{{ sample.path }}`
```
{{ sample.content }}
```
{% endfor %}

## Output Format

Respond in valid YAML with the following structure:

```yaml
project_type: "<type>"
tech_stack:
  languages:
    - "<language>"
  frameworks:
    - "<framework>"
  build_tools:
    - "<tool>"
  key_dependencies:
    - "<dependency>"
important_dirs:
  - path: "<dir>"
    purpose: "<description>"
ignore_dirs:
  - "<dir>"
architecture: "<brief description of layering, module relationships, and design philosophy>"
key_interfaces:
  - name: "<trait/interface/abstract type name>"
    module: "<module or file path>"
    purpose: "<what it abstracts and why>"
data_flows:
  - name: "<flow name, e.g., request handling, feature pipeline>"
    description: "<brief description>"
    stages:
      - "<stage1: what happens>"
      - "<stage2: what happens>"
error_handling_pattern: "<how errors are defined and propagated, e.g., thiserror enums + anyhow context>"
concurrency_model: "<async runtime, channel patterns, shared state strategy>"
```
