Based on the following design specification, generate a verification plan.

## Design Specification

{{ design_spec }}

## Pre-configured Checks

The following checks are executed automatically by the system (do NOT include these in the verification plan — they are run as real subprocesses with real exit codes):
{% for check in checks %}
- `{{ check }}`
{% endfor %}

## Output Format

Generate a Markdown document with the following structure. Focus on verification that **requires judgment** — the automated checks above are handled separately by the system.

```markdown
# Verification Plan: {{ feature_slug }}

## Functional Verification
<Specific scenarios to verify the feature works correctly>
<Each scenario must specify HOW to verify: which test to run, which code path to inspect, or which command to execute>

- [ ] Scenario 1: <description>
  - Verify by: <specific test name, code path, or command>
  - Expected: <what should happen>

- [ ] Scenario 2: <description>
  ...

## Edge Cases
<Edge cases and error conditions to verify>
<Each must be tied to a specific test or code path>

- [ ] <edge case 1>
  - Verify by: <test name or code inspection>
- [ ] <edge case 2>

## Integration Points
<Verify integration with existing components>
<Focus on interfaces, API contracts, and data flow between modules>

- [ ] <integration check 1>
- [ ] <integration check 2>

## Design Conformance
<Verify the implementation matches the design specification>
<Check type safety, error handling patterns, API contracts>

- [ ] <conformance check 1>
- [ ] <conformance check 2>
```

## Guidelines

- Do NOT include automated checks (build, test, lint, format) — these are run by the system
- Focus on behavioral verification that requires judgment
- Each check must specify a concrete verification method (test name, code path, command)
- Do NOT include vague items like "Performance is acceptable" or "Security is adequate" unless the design spec defines specific measurable criteria
- Include both happy path and error cases
- Prioritize checks by importance (critical checks first)
