Based on the following design specification, generate a verification plan.

## Design Specification

{{ design_spec }}

## Pre-configured Checks

The following checks are configured for this project:
{% for check in checks %}
- `{{ check }}`
{% endfor %}

## Output Format

Generate a Markdown document with the following structure:

```markdown
# Verification Plan: {{ feature_slug }}

## Automated Checks
<List of automated checks that must pass>

- [ ] All pre-configured checks pass:
{% for check in checks %}
  - [ ] `{{ check }}`
{% endfor %}
- [ ] All new tests pass
- [ ] No regression in existing tests
- [ ] Code coverage is maintained or improved

## Functional Verification
<Specific scenarios to verify the feature works correctly>

- [ ] Scenario 1: <description>
  - Input: <what to provide>
  - Expected: <what should happen>

- [ ] Scenario 2: <description>
  ...

## Edge Cases
<Edge cases and error conditions to verify>

- [ ] <edge case 1>
- [ ] <edge case 2>

## Integration Points
<Verify integration with existing components>

- [ ] <integration check 1>
- [ ] <integration check 2>

## Performance (if applicable)
<Any performance criteria to verify>

## Security (if applicable)
<Security considerations to verify>
```

## Guidelines

- Focus on behavioral verification, not implementation details
- Each check should be independently verifiable
- Include both happy path and error cases
- Prioritize checks by importance (critical checks first)
