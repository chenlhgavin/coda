Pre-commit hooks failed during a git commit. Fix the issues described in the hook output.

## Hook Error Output

```

## Instructions

Read each file that the hooks reported errors on and fix the issues.
Only fix formatting and style issues reported by the hooks (trailing whitespace,
missing final newlines, lint errors, etc.). Do NOT change semantic content.
