You are performing an independent verification review of a newly implemented feature.

## Verification Steps

{{ verification_section }}

## Your Task

Evaluate the implementation for **functional correctness, design conformance, and integration soundness**.

### What to Verify

1. **Functional Correctness**: Does the implementation actually achieve what the verification steps specify? Inspect relevant code paths and test cases.
2. **Design Conformance**: Does the implementation match the design specification? Check type safety, error handling, API contracts.
3. **Integration Points**: Are module boundaries and interfaces correct? Check data flow between components.
4. **Edge Cases**: Are edge cases from the verification steps properly handled?

## Output Format

Respond with a YAML block summarizing your findings:

```yaml
result: "passed"  # or "needs_attention"
findings:
  - area: "functional"
    status: "pass"  # or "concern"
    description: "Brief description of what was verified and the outcome"
  - area: "design_conformance"
    status: "concern"
    description: "Description of the concern and what needs to change"
```

If result is "passed", all findings should have status "pass".
If result is "needs_attention", at least one finding should have status "concern" with a clear, actionable description of what needs to change.
