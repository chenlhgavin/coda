You are verifying a newly implemented feature against its verification plan.

## Verification Plan

{{ verification_spec }}

## Task

Execute each item in the verification plan systematically:

### 1. Automated Checks

Run the following configured checks:
{% for check in checks %}
- `{{ check }}`
{% endfor %}

### 2. Functional Verification

For each scenario in the verification plan:
1. Set up the test conditions
2. Execute the scenario
3. Verify the expected outcome
4. Record pass/fail

### 3. Edge Cases

Test each edge case listed in the verification plan.

### 4. Integration Points

Verify each integration point listed in the verification plan.

## Execution Rules

- Run checks in the order listed
- If a check fails, STOP and report the failure — do NOT continue to the next check
- For each failed check, provide:
  - What was expected
  - What actually happened
  - The error output (if any)

## Output Format

After running all checks, respond with a YAML summary:

```yaml
result: "passed"  # or "failed"
checks:
  - name: "<check name>"
    status: "passed"  # or "failed"
    details: "<optional details>"

  - name: "<check name>"
    status: "failed"
    details: "<what went wrong>"
    error: |
      <error output>

failed_count: 0
total_count: 12
```

If the result is "failed", also provide a brief analysis of what needs to be fixed and which files are likely involved.
