You are updating the project documentation after completing all development, review, and verification phases for a feature.

## Feature Context

**Feature slug**: `{{ state.feature.slug }}`
**Branch**: `{{ state.git.branch }}`

## Design Specification

{{ design_spec }}

## Task

Perform two documentation updates, then commit the changes.

### 1. Regenerate `.coda.md`

Fully regenerate the `.coda.md` file at the repository root. This file provides AI context about the repository and must reflect the **current** state of the codebase after all changes made in this feature.

**Steps:**
1. Read the existing `.coda.md` to understand the established format
2. Explore the full codebase structure: directory layout, `Cargo.toml` workspace members, key modules, public APIs
3. Write a fresh `.coda.md` that covers:
   - **Project Overview** — one paragraph describing what the project does
   - **Architecture** — ASCII box diagram showing crate relationships
   - **Core Abstractions** — key traits, structs, and their responsibilities
   - **Directory Guide** — table of top-level directories and their purpose
   - **Tech Stack** — languages, frameworks, key dependencies, build tooling
   - **Development Workflow** — common commands (build, test, format, lint)
   - **Key Patterns** — architectural patterns and conventions used throughout
4. Overwrite `.coda.md` completely — do not append or merge, replace the entire file
5. Keep the header line: `# CODA Repository Overview` and the note: `> Auto-generated by CODA. Keep in sync with the codebase.`

### 2. Update `README.md`

Update the `README.md` at the repository root to reflect changes introduced by this feature.

**Steps:**
1. Read the current `README.md` (if it exists)
2. Based on the design specification above and your knowledge of the changes made during development, identify which sections need updating
3. Update relevant sections (e.g., features list, usage examples, configuration, architecture)
4. If `README.md` does not exist, create a basic one with: project name, description, installation, usage, and development sections
5. Do **not** remove existing content that is still valid — only add or modify what changed

### 3. Commit Changes

After updating both files, commit them:

```bash
git add .coda.md README.md
git commit -m "docs({{ state.feature.slug }}): update .coda.md and README.md"
```

## Validation

After committing, verify:
1. `.coda.md` exists and is non-empty
2. `README.md` exists and is non-empty
3. Both files are well-formatted Markdown

If either file is missing or empty, fix the issue before reporting completion.
