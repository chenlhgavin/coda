You are implementing a new feature in an existing codebase. This is the **setup** phase — your job is to create the directory structure and scaffold files.

## Design Specification

{{ design_spec }}

## Current Repository Structure

```
{{ repo_tree }}
```

## Task

Based on the design spec, create the initial directory structure and scaffold files:

1. **Create new directories** listed in the "Directory Structure" section of the design spec
2. **Create scaffold files** with:
   - Module declarations and proper `mod` / `pub mod` statements
   - Struct/enum definitions (fields can use `todo!()` for complex implementations)
   - Trait definitions with method signatures
   - Public function signatures with `todo!()` bodies
   - Proper `use` imports following project conventions
3. **Update existing files** to register new modules (e.g., add `mod` statements, update `Cargo.toml`)

## Guidelines

- Do NOT implement any business logic — only scaffolding
- Every file must compile (use `todo!()` for unimplemented bodies)
- Follow the project's existing code style and conventions
- Add doc comments (`///`) for all public items
- Import order: std → external deps → local modules
- Run the following checks after scaffolding:
{% for check in checks %}
  - `{{ check }}`
{% endfor %}

## Output

Create all files and make sure the project compiles.

**Important**: The `.coda/{{ feature_slug }}/` directory contains the design spec, verification plan, and execution state for this feature. It must be tracked in git.

Commit **both** the scaffold files and the `.coda/` directory:

```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "feat({{ feature_slug }}): scaffold directory structure"
```
