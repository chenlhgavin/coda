You are implementing a new feature in an existing codebase. This is the **implement** phase.

## Design Specification

{{ design_spec }}

{% if resume_context %}
## Resume Context

{{ resume_context }}
{% endif %}

## Current Phase

You are working on **Phase {{ phase_index + 1 }}** of the development plan. Locate the corresponding phase in the "Development Phases" section of the design spec above and implement it.

## Task

Implement the code changes described in Phase {{ phase_index + 1 }}:

1. Replace `todo!()` placeholders with actual implementations
2. Follow the interface design from the spec exactly
3. Handle all error cases properly — no `unwrap()` or `expect()` in production code
4. Add appropriate logging with `tracing` macros

## After Implementation

Run the following checks and fix any issues:
{% for check in checks %}
- `{{ check }}`
{% endfor %}

If any check fails:
1. Read the error output carefully
2. Fix the issue
3. Re-run the checks
4. Repeat until all checks pass

## Commit

Once all checks pass, commit with an appropriate conventional commit message:
`feat({{ feature_slug }}): <concise description of what this phase implements>`

## Guidelines

- Implement ONLY what is described in this phase — do not jump ahead
- Each function should be focused and under 150 lines
- Use the project's existing patterns and conventions
- Prefer borrowing over cloning, iterators over explicit loops
- Add inline comments only for non-obvious logic
